# Random interview questions

This is just a random collection of interview questions I have been asked, or come across.
I have made no effort to cross-correlate this with Hackerrank, or any other entity that serves questions
to programmers.

** Note: **
Most of the answers are in python, and any opinions are just my own expressions.
The answers are not made to be optimal, nor any attempt has been made at performance enhancement, or rarely
any Big O analysis, unless expressly stated.

I may at some point push this all into a Jupyter notebooks for easily play with numbers and visualization.

Cheers!
